# BFMM_SaveTheKoalas

This project was carried out as part of the "624-2 - Software Engineering" module for the Rich Internet Application (RIA) course.

## Description and goal

You play a firefighter who has to go and save koalas during forest fires in Australia. The firefighter has a three-jet water tank. When he has used up his jets, he can go to the well and fill his tank with an extra jet of water.

The firefighter has 3 lives. He loses a life every time he touches a burning bush and reappears in the "safe zone". If all 3 lives are exhausted, the game is over and the score cannot be recorded as the level has not been completed.

The game has 3 different levels in order of increasing difficulty. The player can change levels at any time and the level map and items are reset. The number of koalas to be saved also varies according to the level.

### Notes :
